NOTES


-- Connection with the server --
We should only invoke spotifyGetData and lastFmGetData with one trigger which is conditioned by a WiFi network true (Also for update and send to server)
We should always have a connection with the DBserver during a party even on mobile data
We should always have a connection with the server to check for a party even on mobile data

-- For data --
Try to run somehow the data download in the background (maybe to run the inAppBrowser in the background while the user interacts with the App window)
