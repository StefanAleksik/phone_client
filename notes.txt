NOTES


-- Connection with the server --
We should only invoke spotifyGetData and lastFmGetData with one trigger which is conditioned by a WiFi network true (Also for update and send to server)
We should always have a connection with the DBserver during a party even on mobile data
We should always have a connection with the server to check for a party even on mobile data

-- For data --
Try to run somehow the data download in the background
(maybe to run the inAppBrowser in the background while the user interacts with the App window) - After testing I noticed that there is no need of this


-- Spotify data history --
Spotify has a parameter added_at in the playlist-track, album and track objects
 - https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/#track-object-full  -- The date and time the track was saved.
 - https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/#playlist-track-object -- The date and time the track was added. Note that some very old playlists may return null in this field.
 - https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/#saved-album-object -- The date and time the track was added. Note that some very old playlists may return null in this field.
